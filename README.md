# VLSI-LAB-EXP-5
SIMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF FINITE STATE MACHINE

# AIM: 
To simulate and synthesis finite state machine using Vivado 2023.1.

# SOFTWARE REQUIRED:
Vivado 2023.2

# PROCEDURE:
Open Vivado: Launch Xilinx Vivado software on your computer.

Create a New Project: Click on "Create Project" from the welcome page or navigate through "File" > "Project" > "New".

Project Settings: Follow the prompts to set up your project. Specify the project name, location, and select RTL project type.

Add Design Files: Add your Verilog design files to the project. You can do this by right-clicking on "Design Sources" in the Sources window, then selecting "Add Sources". Choose your Verilog files from the file browser.

Specify Simulation Settings: Go to "Simulation" > "Simulation Settings". Choose your simulation language (Verilog in this case) and simulation tool (Vivado Simulator).

Run Simulation: Go to "Flow" > "Run Simulation" > "Run Behavioral Simulation". This will launch the Vivado Simulator and compile your design for simulation.

Set Simulation Time: In the Vivado Simulator window, set the simulation time if it's not set automatically. This determines how long the simulation will run.

Run Simulation: Start the simulation by clicking on the "Run" button in the simulation window.

View Results: After the simulation completes, you can view waveforms, debug signals, and analyze the behavior of your design.

# VERILOG CODE:
```
module fsm(clk, rst, x, z);

input clk, rst, x;

output z;

reg [2:1] present_state, NEXT_STATE;

parameter S0=2'b00, S1=2'b01, S2=2'b10, S3=2'b11;

always@(x,present_state)

case(present_state)

S0: if(x)

NEXT_STATE=S1;

else

NEXT_STATE=S0;

S1: if(x)

NEXT_STATE=S1;

else

NEXT_STATE=S2;

S2: if(x)

NEXT_STATE=S3;

else

NEXT_STATE=S0;

S3: if(x)

NEXT_STATE=S1;

else

NEXT_STATE=S2;

endcase

always@(negedge rst, posedge clk)

if(rst)

present_state<=S0;

else

present_state<=NEXT_STATE;

assign z=(present_state==S3);

endmodule
```
# OUTPUT:

![EXP-5](https://github.com/sabarezz/VLSI-LAB-EXP-5/assets/165630121/a39fab57-110e-4633-a68d-ec3b2578fb6f)

# RESULT:
Thus,the simulation and synthesis of finite state machine by using vivado has been successfully excecuted and verified.
